To deploy jar file to the maven.utgenome.org server (webdav server), you have to edit your $(HOME)/.m2/settings.xml file, and insert the following WebDAV server settings:

(settings.xml file)
--------------------
<settings>

  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>utgb.dav</id>
      <username>leo</username>
      <password>xxxxxxx</password>
      <filePermissions>664</filePermissions>
      <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>
    </server>
  </servers>


</settings>
---------------------

Then, you can deploy the jar file to the server.
> mvn deploy 

Snapshot libraries (version 1.x.x-SNAPSHOT, etc.) will be generated at:
http://maven.utgenome.org/repository/snapshot/org/utgenome/utgb-core/


You can create a release jar file (version 1.x.x) with the following steps:

> mvn release:prepare
> mvn release:perform

Whene some error occurs, you can undo the changes (although change history remains in the commit of the Mercurial)
> mvn release:rollback


When using SSL based protocol for Mercurial (e.g., https://...), you have to enter username and password in a command line (huh!) 
> mvn release:prepare -Dusername=... -Dpassword=... 

If you worry how the above command works, you can test the behavior with
> mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true


The release artifacts (jar files) will be sent to:
http://maven.utgenome.org/repository/artifact/org/utgenome/utgb-core/


Be careful when creating releases, since no undo is supported for the release artifacts. 
You can use snapshot-releases anytime, because it can be easily overwritten with mvn deploy command. 

SNAPSHOT releases will be never used when creating release artifacts. That means, you hav e to remove all SNAPSHOT jars from dependencies described in pom.xml file when building release artifacts via mvn relese:prepare, mvn release:perform commands.



To locally install the jar file, use 

> mvn install

command.
