usage: rename-fastq -g (read group prefix) (input.fastq) (output.fastq)

Rename the reads in a FASTQ file.  
 
 $ utgb rename-fastq -g HA00001.PE001.L1 input.fastq > renamed.fastq

 
Each read in the FASTQ file will be assigned a name with the following format: 

  (read group prefix).(read ID)
  
Note that, for the paired end runs the reads of the both ends are expected to have 
the same name, so use the same read group prefix for paired-end FASTQ files
belonging to the same lane (e.g., s_1_1.qseq, s_1_2.qseq).
