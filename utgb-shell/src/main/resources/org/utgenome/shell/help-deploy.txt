usage: deploy [option] 

Deploy the project war file into the remote Tomcat server.

If your Tomcat server requires a user name and password to deploy web applications, edit (create if not present)
$HOME/.m2/settings.xml file, and describe the username and password in this file.
 
($HOME is usually C:/Document and Settings/(user name) in Windows, /home/(user name) in Linux, /Users/(user name) in Mac OS X)

Here is an example of settings.xml file:

<settings>
 <servers>
  <server>
    <id>tomcat</id>
    <username>admin</username>
    <password>(your password)</password>
   </server>
 </servers>
</settings>
  
You can change the deploy location (context path) with -p option:   
$ utgb deploy -p "/myapp"
