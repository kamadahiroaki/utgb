# UTGB - The University of Tokyo Genome Browser

UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) is an open-source software for
browsing biological data mapped onto a genome sequence in standard web
browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). 

UTGB Toolkit has the following features:
 * ***Interactive web interface***. UTGB uses AJAX-based web interfaces to avoid excessive reloading of web pages.
 * ***Easy installation***.  UTGB is already equipped with a stand-alone web server and database management system, which will be used for querying genome databases. No need exists to set up these complicated system programs after installing UTGB.
 * ***Portablility***. The generated genome browsers work in Windows, Mac and Linux, and can be used as stand-alone applications in your computers. It is also possible to deploy your genome browsers to remote web servers. 

The UTGB is licensed under an [license.html open source license], and is freely available for both commercial and personal use.
